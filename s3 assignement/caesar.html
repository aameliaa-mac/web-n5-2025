    <h2>What is the Caesar Cipher?</h2>
</div>

    <div class="center">
        <p>The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encrypting text. </p>
        <p> It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the original message (plaintext) is replaced by a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. </p>
        <p> For example, with a shift value of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on.</p>
        <p> The last three letters of the alphabet wrap around to the beginning, so X is substituted with A, Y with B, and Z with C. </p>
        <p> To encrypt a message, you pick a shift value (e.g. 3) and substitute each letter in the plaintext by shifting it that number of positions in the alphabet. </p>
        <p> To decrypt, you reverse the process with the same shift value, moving each letter back the same number of positions. </p>
        <p> The cipher gets its name from Julius Caesar, who allegedly used it with a shift of 3 for confidential military communications. </p>
        <p> While extremely simple, it introduces the basic concept of substitution ciphers that are used in more advanced encryption schemes. </p>
